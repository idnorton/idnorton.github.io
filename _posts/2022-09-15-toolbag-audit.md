title:  "What's in my toolbag?"
---
Picking tools is a tricky expensive task and a few years ago I lost my toolbag which was a pretty devestating thing. So here's my reconstructed toolbag built up over many years since that loss and including many things that weren't in the original and excluding some that were (I don't think the 3.5" floppy cleaner would get much use these days).

## The Bag

| Item | Make and model | Link to equivalent | Comment |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| Medium tool bag | Starrett BGM | [Starrett BGM](https://www.starrett.com/metrology/product-detail/BGM) | I love this bag. It has a hard plastic base and is big enough to take all of the tools listed here. |

## Drivers / screwdrivers

### VDE screwdriver set

Stanley FatMax 6 Piece VDE Screwdriver Set. Sadly these have been discontinued. I'd suggest [Wera VDE 7 piece set)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000297U52) as a replacement. Details of the individual screwdrivers below. The Stanley set did not include a 0.8 x 4.0mm so I had to buy one of those individually.

| Item                        | Details |
| --------------------------- | ------- |
| VDE Screwdriver PZ1         | Wera PZ1 x 80 |
| VDE Screwdriver PZ2         | Wera PZ2 x 100 |
| VDE Screwdriver 0.4 x 2.5mm | Wera 0.4x2.5x80 |
| VDE Screwdriver 0.6 x 3.5mm | Wera 0.6x3.5x100 |
| VDE Screwdriver 0.8 x 4.0mm | Wera 0.8x4.0x100 |
| VDE Screwdriver 1.0 x 5.5mm | Wera 1.0x5.5x125 |
| Voltage tester 0.5 x 3.0mm  | Wera 0.5x3.0x07 Voltage Tester |

### Other screwdrivers / bits

| Stubby pozi driver | Wera 355 PZ stubby | [Wera 355 PZ Pozidriv-head Stubby/carburetor screwdriver](https://products.wera.de/en/screwdrivers_kraftform_plus__series_300_355_pz_stubby.html) | This is one of those occasional use things that's exactly what you need when you need it. |
| Precision screwdriver set | Rolson 32 piece precision screwdriver & tweezers | [Amazon Basics 51-Piece Precision Screwdriver Bit Set](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07V843T2W/) | This is a nice set but the bits don't tend to stay where they should. I'd like something that's a bit more terminal driver style with a spinning cap so suggestion is the Amazon one. |
| Hex bit driver | Wiha Bit Holder Handle with Quick Release - 25874 | [Wiha bit holder 25874](https://cpc.farnell.com/wiha/387-ref-25874/bit-holder-handle/dp/TL05916) | This is the last hex driver you will buy. The sturdy feel of a good quality screwdriver without the usual bulk of a hex driver with a ratchet mechanism or compartments for bit storage. It's a joy to use. |
| Hex bit set | Generic hex bit set | [Rolson 30247 Screwdriver Bit Set](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001TEVY7Y/) | Eh. |
| Hex bit security set | Generic hex bit security set | [Rolson 30629 Security Bit Set](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00473OARU/) | Eh. |

## Mini Pliers / cutters

| Long Nose Plier, 125mm | Draper 60740 | [Draper 60740](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00024AT82/) |  |
| Bent Nose Plier, 125mm | Draper 60742 | [Draper 60742](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00024AT8M/) | |
| Diagonal Side Cutter Plier, 110mm | Draper 60743 38A | [Draper 60743 38A](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00024AT8W/) | |
| End Cutter 105 mm | Draper 60744 | [Draper 60744](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00024AT96/) |  |

These are also available as part of a set [Duratool D00121](https://cpc.farnell.com/duratool/d00121/plier-set-mini-5pc/dp/TL10330) which might be a cheaper approach.

I'd probably recommend the [Knipex KNIPEX Assembly Set 00 20 11](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001094GLY/) now.

| ---- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| Pocket digital multimeter | Micronta 22-171 no longer manufactured | [Generic pocket DMM](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B073QQQRBG/) | Nice small meter but only has basic functionality. DC voltage, AC voltage, diode check, ohm and continuity. That's fine for a basic meter I was to always have in my toolbag. |
| Voltage detector | Schneider IMT23009 | [Amazon Schneider IMT23009](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Schneider-Electric-Rapitest-IMT23009-Voltage/dp/B00LY1CGYC) | Wave it at the wire and it tells you if cutting it will result in sparks |
| UK Mains Socket tester | Deta Socket Tester | [Duratool SC440 Socket Tester](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00L1LJDPK/) | Three neons indicate if a UK plug socket is correctly wired. |

| ---- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| Tiny spirit level | Stabila 17775  Pocket Electric | [Stabila 17775](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003UAT6LQ/) | Small enough that it will fit in a single gang electrical backbox |
| Stanley knife | Stanley knife 10-020 | [Stanley 10-018](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0001IW59A/) | I bought one of these in a Black & Decker factory shop and some time later discovered that they no longer make them. Closest thing linked but not as nice as the 10-020 sadly |

| 8m tape measure | Stanley Tylon 8m | [Stanley Tylon 8m](https://www.screwfix.com/p/stanley-8m-tape-measure-2-pack/2086h) | The two pack is cheaper than individual. Like pencils, you can never find a tape measure when you want one. |
| Centre punch | Eclipse 3.2mm centre punch | [Eclipse 3.2mm centre punch](https://cpc.farnell.com/neill-tools/351a/centre-punch-3-2mm-dia-351a/dp/TL00066) | |

| IDC punchdown tool | Draper punch down tool | [Draper punch down tool](https://www.uktoolcentre.co.uk/products/draper-punch-down-tool.html?sku=964288) | Check your tool type with the terminations you plan to use and get the one that matches. This is good for BT style and data cabling but better may exist for whichever type of socket you pick |
| Allen key set | Wera Hex Key Set, With Holder, Metric, 9 Piece | [Hex Key Set, With Holder, Metric, 9 Piece](https://www.screwfix.com/p/wera-l-keys-metric-multicolour-blacklaser-hex-plus-set-9-pieces/474fp) |  |
| Magnetic pickup tool | Generic Telescopic Magnetic Pick Up Tool | [Telescopic Magnetic Pick Up Tool](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0871TGVLN/) | Specifically you want the one with the small magnetic head. Don't play with it, or it will break. Every. Time. |

## Other tools

Some tools are not frequent use enough to keep in my main toolbag so they
live in either their own boxes with the relevant consumables or just in
the general infrequent use bag.

Hard to believe I started writing this post in October 2021. Time to ship it.
